# LED Lights Sequences

This repository contains a project developed during the **fifth semester** of the **Systems Engineering** program at the **Catholic University of Córdoba**, as part of the course **Computer Architecture I** (Plan 2016).

👨‍🏫 **Professor**: Luis Toledo

## 🧠 Project Description

This project implements **four different LED light sequence patterns**, developed for embedded systems.

- **Two of the sequences were programmed in C**
- **Two were implemented in Assembly**

The purpose of the project was to gain hands-on experience working with low-level programming and understand how different programming paradigms interact directly with hardware components.

Although no screenshots are included, the project involved controlling real LED hardware to execute light patterns with varying timing and behavior.

## 💡 Key Learning Outcome

This project was especially valuable in helping me understand the **critical role of hardware** in software development. Writing code that interfaces directly with physical components taught me how low-level design decisions can affect performance, precision, and the overall behavior of a system.

It was a foundational step in bridging the gap between **software logic** and **hardware behavior** — a crucial skill for anyone working in systems engineering.
